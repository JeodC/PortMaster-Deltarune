## Installation
Download the Windows version from https://tobyfox.itch.io/deltarune and unzip to `deltarune/assets`.

## Notes
The current port version DOES NOT FUNCTION! It will run the launcher, but since the new GM function [game_change()](https://manual.gamemaker.io/beta/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/General_Game_Control/game_change.htm) does not support Android, the individual chapters will not launch.
